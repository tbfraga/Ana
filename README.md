--> About the next chapter of Ana: The Policy of Silence

    *** This chapter will be a long chapter. It is possible that it is later divided into several chapters.

    *** Due to the complexity and relevance of the theme, I will present a strong bibliographic basis.

    *** The discussion will be developed for several days (or weeks).

    *** For for this it will be necessary a long research.

--> But it follows the relationship of the themes I am drawing for this chapter.
    
    *** If there is any questions about Covid was created;

    *** Convergences and divergences between the right and mathematics sciences;

    *** The similarity between the symptoms of covid and the symptoms that are caused by the use of nanomaterials;

    *** Invisibility of nanorobotic;

    *** The urgency for accountability, punishment and regulatory creation;

    *** The information industry and the human alienation;

    *** The relationship about the covid and the policy of horror;

    *** Ridiculation of critical thinking and the resignation of the term negationism;

    *** Why we need to talk about it;

    *** Human rights and other living beings rights.

--> Why do I believe entrepreneurs and scientists have created and spread COVID (or the fear of COVID)?

    *** data acquisition;

    *** technology development, especially in the areas of robotics and bioscience;

    *** development of artificial intelligences (brains);

    *** high performance computing using human brains;

    *** control over information and people;

    *** and of course: money and power.
